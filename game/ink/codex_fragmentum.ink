* [Attempt to repair the fragment]
    The glyphs tremble beneath your will. You reach for the old verbs...

        The air tightens. You whisper: `compile invoke bind`.

        The fragment stabilizes â€” for now. A single new line appears: `{sacrum.revertere}`

        The code resists you. Syntax error: *Verbum non agnoscitur.*
        A shriek echoes in your skull.

* [Study the fragment]
    You trace its shape without touching. A memory blooms behind your eyes.
