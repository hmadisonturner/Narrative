    modern gentleman. You awaken with a pounding headache, vague
    memories of last night's escapades flooding back. Your phone is

    materializes from his charging station in the corner, his
    android form moving with perfect precision. "Good morning, sir.
    I trust you slept well, despite the... circumstances," he says,
    one eyebrow slightly raised.</text>

    informing you that your late-night karaoke performance of "I

    momentarily taken aback by your enthusiasm, then gives you a
    narrow-eyed look of suspicion that quickly fades. "Well. It's
    refreshing to see you taking an interest in culture rather than
    making a spectacle of yourself." She stands, gathering her
    dental appointment folder. "I'll see you at two o'clock sharp,
    Bertram. Don't be late, and for heaven's sake, wear something
    appropriate." As she leaves, your phone chimes. Jeeves' message
    reads: "A most fortuitous turn of events, sir. Shall I arrange
    suitable attire for both the dental appointment and symphony?"
    You text back: "Jeeves, you're an absolute wonder, but even you
    couldn't have predicted THIS turn of events!" His reply comes
    instantly: "On the contrary, sir. The probability of Miss
    Bassett's aesthetics conflicting with Mrs. Gregson's
    traditional values was calculated at 87.3%. Though I confess
    the symphony tickets were an unexpected variable." You shake
    your head in amazement. Once again, crisis averted—thanks to a

    <text>"What exactly do you mean by 'countermeasures,' Jeeves?
    Nothing illegal, I hope?" "Certainly not, sir. I have simply
    initiated a series of digital reputation management protocols.
    First, I've deployed a network of friendly bots to report the
    video for copyright infringement of the musical selection.
    Second, I've arranged for several more prominent social media
    events to trend in its place. And third, I've taken the liberty
    of making a small donation from your account to the Drones Club
    restoration fund, which has inspired the management to issue a
    statement praising your 'enthusiastic support of the arts.'"
    Jeeves displays a notification on his chest monitor showing
    that #WoosterWildOut has already dropped from the top trending
    position, replaced by a viral video of a water-skiing squirrel.
    "Additionally, sir, I've edited your social media biography to
    indicate that you have recently been researching performance
    art for a charity fundraiser, thus contextualizing last night's
    activities within a more purposeful framework."</text>

    <text>"I appreciate the help, Jeeves, but I think I should
    handle this myself. After all, how difficult can it be to
    juggle a dental appointment and a charity gala?" Jeeves'
    expression remains neutral, but his bow tie interface pulses a
    skeptical blue. "As you wish, sir." You pull out your phone and
    begin texting Madeline: "Awfully sorry, something's come up
    with my aunt this afternoon. Rain check on the gala?" Almost
    instantly, she replies: "Oh Bertie! Of course family comes
    first! I'll come with you to support your aunt, and then we can
    go to the gala together afterward! Two acts of kindness in one
    day! The universe is aligning! 🌟✨🔮" You stare at your phone in
    horror. "Jeeves, help." "Perhaps, sir," he responds with just
    the faintest hint of I-told-you-so in his voice, "we might
    revert to my original suggestion?"</text>

    <text>"Aunt Agatha takes priority, Jeeves. One does not simply
    ignore a summons from the nephew-crusher." "A most prudent
    decision, sir. Mrs. Gregson's capacity for sustained
    displeasure is indeed formidable." You gulp down the last of
    your hangover tea and stand up with as much dignity as you can
    muster. "What about the other commitments? Madeline and her
    charity thing?" "I've taken the liberty of composing a message
    to Miss Bassett, sir. It expresses your sincere regret at
    having to miss her event due to an unexpected family
    obligation, while simultaneously complimenting her charitable
    nature and suggesting an alternative date next week—when you
    are scheduled to be at your club's golf retreat." You raise an
    eyebrow. "Bit devious, isn't it?" "I prefer to think of it as
    optimal schedule management, sir. The message also includes a
    donation to her cause, which my psychological projection models
    suggest will redirect her attention from your absence to your
    generosity."</text>

    <text>"Jeeves, old thing, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. Any
    thoughts on resolving these scheduling conflicts without
    incurring the wrath of Aunt Agatha or giving Madeline Bassett
    the wrong idea?" Jeeves' bow tie interface transitions to a
    confident green. "Indeed, sir. I've already formulated several
    potential approaches." He produces a tablet displaying a
    flowchart of remarkable complexity. "The optimal solution
    appears to be what I call the 'Cascading Obligation Gambit.'
    You will attend Aunt Agatha's appointment as promised, during
    which I will send an automated message to Miss Bassett
    expressing your eagerness to attend her event but regrettably
    informing her of a delay due to your aunt's appointment running
    long." "Following this, I will arrange for your cousin Claude
    to call you precisely at 5:47 PM with an 'urgent family matter'
    that requires your immediate attention. This will allow you to
    make a brief appearance at Miss Bassett's event, fulfilling
    social expectations while providing a legitimate excuse for an
    early departure." "Throughout these maneuvers, I will be
    systematically addressing the social media situation through a
    series of strategic countermeasures."</text>
